 end of this century is characterized by a renewed interest in national 
questions. On the one hand, one sees the discovery of cultural heritage 
and the demand for recognition by numerous minorities. On the other, the
 intemationalisation of economic processes leads to the questioning of 
traditional memberships and the emphasis on subjective elements in the 
choice of "nation". With this scenario in mind, the authors set out to 
investigate the relationship between statistics and the processes of 
nation-building in European history. In fact, there is a correspondence 
in timing between the affirmation of the principle of nationality and 
the diffusion of statistical science and practices in XIX century 
Europe. How can this correspondence be explained? Did statistics carry 
out an instrumental role or did it condition the development of 
"nationhood"? </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Two
 factors acted as an intermediary between statistics and the nationality
 principle: the beginnings of the modem notions of political economy and
 public opinion. Working on these two levels, statistics was called to 
define a coherent network for the different civil societies (The 
"nations"). Statistics showed that it could adjust to the social, 
cultural, and economic changes occurring within each community. For 
example, the development of labour statistics was instrumental to the 
extension of citizenship to the working class at the beginning of this 
century. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In 
general, statistics carried out a highly relevant role of "monitoring" 
the needs expressed by the civil society, cooperating in the 
codification of the national identity drawn from science to knowledge, 
rather than myths, symbols and flags. Statistics, in short, was a 
formidable tool for "social cohesion" in the various nation States: the 
more prepared it was to lead to values of tolerance and sharing in the 
demands expressed by the civil society, the more effective it was. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Naturally,
 within each national experience, the specific components necessary to 
insure the public relevance of statistics acted differently. For 
example, during the XIX century "political economy" was prevalent where 
there were deep economic transformations, such as in Great Britain 
during the industrial revolution. Conversely, the public administration 
became the focal point when the nation was understood as a product of 
history, rather than a natural fact, as in the French case. Finally, 
science seemed to prevail in those contexts, as in Germany and Belgium, 
where the scientific method was acclaimed for its autonomous, 
"constitutional" role. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Statistics
 is called to work on these same elements today, continuing to make the 
fundamental contribution that it has rendered in the past, and 
responding to the new technological and institutional challenges of the 
future. </p><a id="AN9710051198-2"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9710051198-2" title=" 1. Introduction  "> 1. Introduction  </a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In
 many respects the end of this century has been characterized by a 
renewed interest in, and attention to, national issues. In numerous 
countries national feeling and the awareness of belonging to a national 
community have been questioned as a result of the sweeping economic, 
social and institutional changes underway. The globalization of markets 
and the internationalisation of economic processes are forcing down 
national barriers and boundaries. Regional integration processes appeal,
 directly or indirectly, to affiliations and forms of solidarity that go
 beyond traditional national spheres (for example, Europe, but also 
NAFTA and ASEAN, etc.). Unemployment, social exclusion, economic and 
production crises determined by technological breakthroughs and changing
 markets are eroding the sense of belonging and of identity of many 
national communities, dividing them between haves and have nots, between
 those who participate and those who are excluded. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In
 certain contexts the rediscovery or development of a common historical 
and cultural heritage in regions or local situations has led to demands 
to recognise new nationalities; in others the concern for the survival 
of identities tied to minorities or local cultures feeds the claims of 
specific national traits and distinctions; in others still, age-old and 
never-stilled cultural conflicts have re-emerged replete with their 
ancient past of hostility. It has been estimated that, world-wide, there
 are between 4,000 and 6,000 situations of social groups that claim or 
could claim recognition of national status on the basis of common 
assumptions of cultural, linguistic, territorial, ethnic or religious 
homogeneity. The development of statistical systems, methods and 
techniques, and of capabilities to capture and process data today makes 
possible a "deep reading" of the different aspects of homogeneity and 
diversity, of the mode of functioning of different societies. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 protection of national feeling, which is seen or presumed to be 
threatened or violated, finds a basis in the need to build, consolidate,
 maintain or rediscover bonds of individual and collective identity, new
 and old community roots, in a context in which competition is forcing 
individuals to continually adjust their behaviour and culture, causing 
them to question habits, routines, relationships, etc. Even national 
institutional systems and cultures have begun to compete with one 
another. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">In 
this context there is a risk that research and competition may 
degenerate into conflict, intolerance and discrimination, into 
regurgitations of xenophobic nationalism, fomenting a culture based on 
prevarication and supremacy, ethnic, cultural or religious 
fundamentalism, thus posing serious threats to peace, security and 
coexistence among peoples. Unfortunately, recent history has offered 
clear examples of how serious and current these risks actually are. 
Statistics plays a delicate and difficult role in these processes: it 
can perform an essential function in supporting research, dialogue and 
the development of new forms of civil co-existence and collective 
identity; but it can also find itself prey to risks of manipulation and 
subordination. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 reaction of countries and of the international community to this new 
demand for identity and recognition of cultural roots has until now been
 sadly wanting, first and foremost in terms of comprehending the problem
 and, consequently, in terms of political initiatives and responses. 
Some people, assuming that the collapse of the Berlin Wall had put an 
end to such questions, consider the nation an obsolete concept and an 
obstacle to progress, which is presumed to be moving, instead, in the 
direction of internationalism and universalism. Others, on the contrary,
 defend the nation "as is", the bulwark of civilisation against any 
yield of sovereignty, against cultural contamination and any 
questioning. Still others preach an indiscriminate application of the 
principle of self-determination at the regional and local level, with 
the risk of setting off more or less deliberate, and more or less 
violent, ethnic cleansing operations. Such reactions reveal an upsetting
 lack of preparation and reflection. There has not yet been adequate 
reflection on the role of statistics, either. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">For
 this reason we must start by recognising that the national question is 
today relevant and complex and must legitimately be raised in all its 
aspects, and that particular attention must be devoted to its 
relationship with statistics. The question is, of course, qualified by a
 profoundly different context than in the past. Economic and productive 
conditions have changed; the technologies and tools of communication, 
which nurture a cross-fertilisation of cultures and knowledge, have 
changed; lifestyles and working styles, which are increasingly 
influenced by guidelines of mobility and flexibility and less influenced
 by a stable relationship with the territory, with ethnic culture and 
with religious practices, etc., have changed. Official statistics has 
also changed. But the question of the nation, of its significance, of 
its meaning in relation to the identity and cohesion of the community 
and the effectiveness of its institutional structures remains pivotal. 
In fact, we believe that in the next century there will be an explosion 
of nations and national questions born out of the growing integration or
 disintegration of previous systems, out of the emergence of new 
cultures or the rediscovery of old values, out of the desire to 
distinguish local areas or small groups, out of the crossing and 
separation of different cultural bonds, old and new. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 nations and the international community must prepare themselves to 
manage these processes, turning this explosion into an occasion for 
cultural growth, for social dynamism and for improvement in the forms of
 peaceful co-existence among peoples. All the potential that statistics 
can offer must be used in the service of this evolution. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We
 believe, in fact, that statistics can play a key role in giving the 
national questions a perspective of civility and progress and in 
thwarting forms of degeneration and regression. And we also believe that
 the historical analysis of the relationship between statistics and 
nation-building may offer important insights into the tasks of 
statistics, into the risks hazarded when statistics is not given its 
due, and into the vast opportunities revealed in the choice of different
 models of organisation and development of national statistics. </p><a id="AN9710051198-3"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9710051198-3" title=" 2. The evolution of the concept of nation  "> 2. The evolution of the concept of nation  </a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">After
 World War II, and particularly in recent years, historians, 
sociologists and anthropologists have frequently explored the genesis 
and content of the concept of nation. We will bypass the different 
taxonomic classifications scholars have created in attempting to explain
 the concept in its various manifestations and go straight to the least 
common denominator these studies share: "nation" involves the assumption
 by a given society of a common cultural identity, in order to achieve 
some form of political recognition up to the ultimate level, 
sovereignty, and the model of the "nation-state". Different factors may 
predominate in the building of the nation-state. And the process may 
occur in several ways: centrifugally - the political consecration of a 
specific cultural identity, or centripetally the extension of the 
political boundaries to cover the range of cultural unity. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 historical character of the term "nation" and its relationship with 
specific conditions of economic and social development is of great 
significance. As Ernest Gellner [ 13] explained on this point - as if to
 justify the continual implosion of nationalisms in the 20th century 
-the term "nation", in the strict sense, assumes the existence of a 
specific socio-economic scenario: the transition from an agricultural to
 an industrial society. The agricultural society, with its well-defined 
social structure and a network of relatively stable and well-ordered 
substructures, does not require a unitary identity. The scenario offered
 by the industrial society is quite different: the criterion of 
affiliation is fluid and random, and there are no intermediaries between
 the individual and the global community. In this scenario the role of 
cultural boundaries takes on a far stronger value of identity and tends 
to be incarnated in the national state with its strong prerogatives: 
this is the incubator of the modem concept of nationality. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">"Industrial
 society" can be defined, beyond and before being a specific form of 
organisation of production, as the emergence on the economic plane of a 
new way of being of civil society. We are alluding, in this case, to the
 emergence of the "social sphere" defined by Hannah Arendt as "the 
advent of domestic administration, its activities, problems and 
organisational tools from the dark interior of the home to the light of 
the public arena" [1]. This is the process that innovates the 
pre-industrial economic concept, centred around the "pater familias" and
 the existence of the oikos, and through the development of the market 
proclaims economics "political", i.e., the political economy. At the 
same time, the public interest in the private sphere of civil society is
 not only the object of attention of the government, that is the 
traditional structure of the princeps; instead, it is considered by all 
subjects (or their most qualified part) as their own interest. In this 
manner that "critical" space is created through which the new civil 
society, as a private entity, operates in opposition to the State, but 
at the same time, as a significant interlocutor on the public plane, the
 same civil society defines itself as the space of political legitimacy 
[14] and as "public" opinion. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Political
 economy and public opinion are, therefore, necessary, even though not 
sufficient, elements in the building of modem national identities. And 
it is precisely through them that statistics has operated in the 
processes of nation-building. Over time, and particularly in the last 
decades of this century, both the structure of production and the mode 
of being of civil society have undergone profound transformations that 
have had a great impact on the concept of the nation, its meaning and 
its function. On the one hand, because of the new possibilities of 
technology, production processes are acquiring wider geographical 
spheres and greater pervasiveness compared to social and cultural 
organization. Production processes are also dematerialising and becoming
 more flexible. These processes gnaw at the foundations of certain 
classic prerogatives of state sovereignty, undermining the autonomy and 
effectiveness of policies and requiring more articulated institutional 
forms. We can mention, in this regard, the sectors of currency, defence,
 the regulation of international trade, even public finance. In all the 
fields in which the State can no longer perform its tasks alone, the 
instances of international organisation (e.g., the processes of 
regionalization) and of bringing the institutions closer to the citizens
 (e.g., fiscal federalism, decentralisation) are reinforced. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">And
 society itself is undergoing a profound transformation. Lifestyles and 
types of households are becoming diversified. Professional, social and 
geographic mobility is growing. New subjects (women and the elderly) are
 increasingly participating or asking to participate in production. The 
cultural level of the population, especially among the young, is rising.
 Old and new forms of social exclusion and marginalization, unemployment
 and inequality are emerging. New social and cultural networks - the 
non-profit sector, Internet and spare-time activities -are being 
generated. These processes are fully reflected in individual and 
collective identities and determine a continual search for new forms of 
homogeneity and aggregation to escape isolation and fragmentation. A 
strong demand to redefine and develop the content and mode of expressing
 a national identity has been born. There are new demands to recognise 
national claims which, even when they appear to be looking backward, are
 very much influenced by a vision of the future. Opportunities for 
individual and collective choice of cultural identity are growing and, 
in the crucible of cross-fertilisation of cultural movements, their 
convergences, overlappings, distinctions, differences and reciprocal 
influences among these opportunities are multiplying. Consequently, 
cultural identities explode and the opportunities to choose, create or 
unmake them explode with them. As a result, nations of a same people 
explode and different peoples aspire to become part of broader national 
aggregations. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 sphere of intervention of public opinion has also been modified. Once a
 space for rational actors exercising a critical institutional function 
vis-a-vis the political and social powers, public opinion has now also 
become the target on which to unleash the messages and conditioning of 
the mass media. With the growing gap in social roles, the contrast 
within civil society between those who "create" opinion (the leaders of 
political, productive and social organisations) and those who "undergo" 
it, between the institutions of mediation and consensus and the 
depoliticized sphere of mere cultural consumption, is becoming clearer 
and clearer. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 newest and most innovative aspect of this evolution is the shattering 
of the simplicity and clarity of concepts that were the basis of the 
equation "nation-state". Models of a multinational state are advancing 
(the United States, in certain respects). One nation organises itself 
into various states or regions (the Federal Republic of Germany, for 
example). A nation becomes multicultural and able to contain different 
nations. The exclusive bond between the individual and national 
affiliation is loosening (e.g., double citizenship, extending the right 
to vote to "foreigners", etc.). National feeling is becoming more 
dynamic and "historicized", changing over time, in a lifetime, in 
history. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The 
modem concept of the nation is not only not exiting the stage but is 
reappearing widely and in new forms. Today, in fact, there is still no 
correspondence between processes of globalization and the 
interdependence of markets, on the one hand, and a clear trend toward 
cultural convergence, on the other. On the contrary, new forms of sub-or
 supranational entropy are flourishing. And today we are still operating
 in a world in which the importance of public opinion, even in its 
passive, mass media communications dimension, is still accepted. It will
 be up to statistics to restore to public opinion its original role by 
recovering critical spaces for civil society. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 profound changes taking place in recent years continue to involve the 
role of statistics, which, in the process of building the cultural 
identities underlying the concept of nation, has always performed an 
important function. If the nation becomes part of history, it becomes 
subject to the rhythm and pattern of history; history conditions its 
dynamics. So, if the nation is not, but is becoming, if it does not look
 backward but forward, statistics is called upon to provide a 
contribution to "national development" on a continuous basis and in a 
broad and pervasive manner. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">European
 history reveals how diverse have been the channels of formation and

 travelling back through the history of statistical thought, we run up 
against a controversial chapter between the end of the eighteenth and 
the first decade of the nineteenth century. In those years, in fact, the
 word "statistics" became a definitive part of the majority of European 
languages. At the same time, this noun was used to express concisely a 
scientific procedure that made a clean break with earlier studies of 
"political arithmetics". </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 incompatibility is only apparent. If we place this event in its 
specific historical-cultural context, we can comprehend the purpose 
assigned to statistics in relation to the building and development of 
the nation. This purpose implicitly continues to shape the meaning of 
official statistics even today. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 fact that the "era of enthusiasm" [29] for statistical investigations 
(18301849) overlapped with the historical epoch of greatest expansion of
 the principle of nationality is no mere chronological coincidence. 
Starting with the Belgian Revolution (1830), we can affirm that the 
institution of independent offices of statistics was used as a symbol 
for the achievement of national sovereignty. The creation of a 
short-lived -- but significant -- independent statistical service in 
Hungary during the 1848 revolution comes to mind. It was quashed after 
only a few months but reintroduced during the Compromise of 1867 which 
established the Austro-Hungarian Empire on a footing of equality. The 
equally significant institution of the Imperial Statistics Office in 
Berlin in 1872 also comes to mind. In a formative phase of national 
identity, statistics often assumed a key role, weaving civil society 
into a coherent web and taking on political tasks, as well. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Given
 this active role of political militancy in national movements, 
consistency with the basic principles of the deontology of official 
statistics, in particular impartiality and objectivity, was not always 
respected. In the case of the Italian Risorgimento, we might ask whether
 the civil passions and direct political involvement of many 
statisticians were in keeping with the statute of "scientific" method of
 the administration, which did and does characterise the discipline. The
 post-union devotees of the Italian statistical tradition (A. 
Messedaglia and F. Lampertico, for example) recall how in certain cases 
statistics was the "tool of conspiracy and struggle", a "military and 
fighting" science during the Risorgimento. One of the great protagonists
 of that period of "resurgence" of statistics, Cesare Correnti, admitted
 this openly. With national unity won, Correnti also expressed his 
discomfort and a certain reluctance: </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">"I
 was born for other things. ... And I put my hand into this numerical 
shower of stones only out of desperation and the necessity of war. Forty
 years ago, when we were at the dawn of things to come and life was 
raging in our hands and poetry in our hearts, our venerable teacher Gian
 Domenico Romagnosi began to make us aware of how statistics could be a 
lighter and sharper weapon than the historical lamentations and poetic 
anathemas handled by so many so well and so uselessly. So I resigned 
myself, an impatient recruit, to the discipline of averages, tables and 
numbers, which gave us the possibility of speaking in jargon and codes, 
and of escaping the circumcision of censorship" [19]. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As
 Correnti testified, "militant" statistics was also born out of a 
reaction to censorship and the scant public information supplied by the 
"absolutist" governments of the times. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">On
 the other hand, cases of political exploitation of statistics in the 
19th century are relatively easy to find. The problem that is raised in 
historical evaluation, and which is also echoed in questions regarding 
the present, concerns the relationship between statistics and civil 
movements, between statistics and political-social conflicts, and 
between statistics and national conflicts. Up to what point can 
impartial and objective statistics be moved by civil passions, 
transforming itself into a participant in the interpretation of the 
travails of society, into a "political" explanation of history? Up to 
what point can we risk the independence and scientific character of 
statistics in order to comprehend, document and interpret national 
questions? The fundamental principles regarding the objectivity of 
statistics are clear. It is very difficult to apply these principles to 
the analysis and practice of history. It is by no means easy to strike a
 balance between the two models, the ideological and extremist models of
 militant statistics or statistics of the regime, on one side, and of 
ascetic and detached statistics, on the other. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">As
 various studies have shown [10, 22], in the case of the principle of 
nationality we are dealing with a process of codification based on 
active, conventional elements tied to cultural and political visions in 
order to "build" a cultural equivalent, between realities not 
immediately comparable, of a cultural identity that does not exist in 
nature. For these "subjective" reasons nations have been able to define 
themselves in different ways through statistics, as any other social 
institution. There is a very tight link between the political and 
cognitive dimensions of every codification. This link explains the 
public significance of statistics, why statistics is traditionally 
considered a public function, although not necessarily at the government
 level. We do not intend to fall into cultural relativism in these 
affirmations and declare that "nations" are arbitrary inventions on the 
basis of their opposing and often contradictory declinations, which 
statistics "legitimises" and justifies subserviently and 
unscientifically. But it is equally unacceptable the militant positivism
 which raged at the turn of this century breaking the link between the 
prescriptive and descriptive dimensions of social phenomena. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">If
 nations do not exist in nature, but are built and rebuild themselves 
continuously, statistics cannot be limited to "surveying" and 
"recording". It must also understand and give a voice to the 
aspirations, needs and visions of peoples, relating these subjective 
elements to facts, analyses, reality. Statistics is not, therefore, a 
mechanical tool, a mere technique in the service of the user. Statistics
 is a science, a method of democratic confrontation, an institutional 
network of citizens interacting, a language for communication among 
people. It is not true, then, that any aggregation aiming at nationhood 
can be justified, in its generic and permanent character, if it serves 
some end, if it creates something that is operative and upon which it is
 possible to act [9]. The cultural identity that gives substance to the 
nation exists, and resists, only if it is supported by documented 
objective and subjective elements, if it is verified by facts; in other 
words, if it is based on effective, good quality statistics that are 
able to read and monitor these facts. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 history of Swiss statistics provides a positive example of balance 
between objectivity and participation. In 1847 Stefano Franscini, 
Interior Minister of the Swiss Confederation, published the first two 
volumes of the New Statistics of Switzerland. This was not yet an 
official publication, but the political office held by its author 
anointed the work with an unusual official aura. Franscini's aim, 
explicitly declared in the closing chapters, was to give Switzerland the
 image of a strong identity to counter the 18th century vision of a 
fragmented, pastoral, Alpine Switzerland. Franscini was not attempting a
 mere cultural operation. There was a topical political need pressing 
upon the country. The year 1847 represented one of the most critical 
moments in Switzerland's history. The attempt to secede by the 
conservative Sonderbund was manifest. Franscini turned to statistics to 
demonstrate that the sense of Swiss identity and its form of affiliation
 were structured according to precise social models (the extension of 
small landownership, for example), original aggregative forces at the 
cantonal level and specific cultural idioms drawn from the best European
 liberal tradition. In other words, Franscini did not simply describe 
the Swiss nation but contributed to building it through the statistical 
indices on material well-being, on domestic trade, and on prevailing 
cultural practices. </p><a id="AN9710051198-5"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9710051198-5" title=" 4. Statistics and freedom  "> 4. Statistics and freedom  </a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Another
 aspect is worth stressing. The nexus between statistics and nation, 
which was so tight in the first half of the 19th century, was also 
influenced by another element which reflected the political culture of 
those years - liberalism. The example of Stefano Franscini demonstrates 
that the use of statistics to define a specific national identity was 
all the more necessary the more the principle of nationality resisted 
definition on the basis of mere ethnic, linguistic or religious 
criteria, and relied on the exuberant "ideals" of modernity, instead: 
social interaction, unification of markets, acquired levels of civic 
culture. The German experience confirms this, even though Germany has 
always stressed the importance of the ius sanguinis in defining its own 
criterion of affiliation. In Germany the Zollverein, the customs union 
of 1833, inaugurated the first unified statistical system, which was 
extended to all member states. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 modem nation therefore assigned a key role to statistics. This is the 
nation based on the model of a liberal society, on the market economy, 
on the tolerance of diversities. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However,
 it is incumbent upon us to recall that statistics has also operated in 
other directions. We need only refer to the totalitarian experiences of 
the 20th century. In Italy, for example, during the Fascist era official
 statistics were sometimes bent to the need to "nationalise" the masses 
dictated by the regime, and subordinated to the key "ideological" catch 
words: ruralism, racial discrimination, rising birth rates. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">This
 tension in the relationship between statistics and freedom also emerged
 in the 19th century in connection with the development of linguistic 
nationalities. We can draw an example from the International Statistical
 Congresses (1853-1876) promoted by Adolphe Quetelet. These congresses 
aimed at introducing harmonised international standards in all the 
participating states, which corresponded, with few exceptions, to the 
entire continent of Europe. In 1872, at the VII Session of the congress 
in St. Petersburg, the German proposal to insert a question regarding 
language in censuses was accepted. This question was implicitly assumed 
to be an indicator of nationality. In this way statistics contributed to
 uncoupling the national problem from the vision of "political economy",
 which, for example, had been adopted by Franscini. It was no longer the
 integration of markets and the resulting social interaction that made a
 nation and gave it its "common denominator", measurable in 
socio-economic indices. In posing the question on language, the censuses
 encouraged each and all not only to choose a nationality, but to choose
 a linguistic nationality [ 16]. In the censuses of 1880 and 1910 the 
question had a shattering effect on the cohesion of the Austrian 
administration [5]. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">It
 is interesting to note that Richard Boeckh, the representative of the 
German delegation at the Congress that pushed for adoption of the 
language recommendation, was a young philologist who in certain writings
 [2, 3] had asserted that the statistical characteristics of daily 
language were the distinctive trait of a nation and were far more 
important than descent, race or religion. As he saw it, the Ashke-nazi 
Jews should be classified as Germans, since spoken Yiddish was actually a
 German dialect derived from medieval German. In 1880, as Director of 
the statistics office of the city of Berlin, Boeckh was the only German 
statistics official to openly speak of the "abuse and corruption of 
statistics due to anti-Semitic agitation", referring to the data 
released by the Imperial Statistics Office regarding the increase in 
Jewish immigration from Galicia [15]. </p><a id="AN9710051198-6"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9710051198-6" title=" 5.

 European history statistics has not only helped define and consolidate 
the principle of nationality. Within the individual nation states 
statistics has also been a tool for the progressive extension of 
citizenship. This, in fact, is the most significant contribution of 
statistics to the process of nation-building. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Nationalism,
 the pathological degeneration of national feeling, of which there are, 
sadly, many examples in the past and present, proposes the idea of a 
monolithic and, in certain ways, a historical nation. Ethnicities, 
languages and religions are, individually or together, presumed to be 
almost naturalistic criteria of identity. But, if we consider it 
historically, the nation is a concept built over time, and it changes 
the more that political and anthropological definitions of the term can 
be distinguished in its formulation. In other words, the more the 
criterion of citizenship determines the criterion of nationality, the 
more the concept of the nation changes. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 concerns over "integration", implicit in every definition of cultural 
homogeneity the nation expresses, brings into focus the role of 
institutions. The role for instance of schools in building the 
republican identity in France is well known [18]. How does statistics 
operate within the processes of cultural integration? If we look for the
 minimum common denominator, we find that statistics has cooperated in 
this process in nation states essentially through one concept - that of 
dispersion or variance. Either through emphasis on the descriptive tools
 of statistics, or in the season of numerical calculus on probabilistic 
basis, it is above all through the identification of deviations and 
differences that statistics contributes to the process of building 
national identity. This is the role statistics played in France from 
1801 to 1804, when the first statistical offices were inaugurated on a 
departmental basis, the so-called "statistics of the prefects"; the 
descriptions of the time converged in registering delays and anomalies 
in relation to the new individualist society proclaimed in 1789, and 
which was soon destined to be consecrated in the austere forms of the 
Civil Code [31]. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Statistics
 continued to play this same role throughout the 19th century. The 
debates on the "normality" of the bell curve bring to mind the heavy 
ideological investment European culture poured into the development of 
different statistical methods. Through the identification of a constant 
regularity within a range of apparently disordered phenomena, reality 
was standardised, its anomalies obscured. The "normal law" bore a 
reference to an underlying deterministic structure, just as the "common 
man" theorised by Quetelet played a role in expressing the values of 
moderation and the juste milieu adopted by 19th century liberal society 
[20]. These assumptions provide a valid justification for the attempts 
to make statistical surveying uniform promoted during the International 
Statistical Congresses from 1853 to 1878. The belief in a European 
similarity in customs, socio-economic structures and development trends,
 as the interpretation of reality indicated by the new statistical 
procedures, was responsible for this unitary approach. And the 
significance accorded to the relationship between variance and deviance 
is what justified the expansion in the 19th century of statistical 
surveys that, at the time, were defined "moral statistics". Crime, 
public education, public health, medicine and anthropometrics 
represented the privileged areas of study in 19th century advanced 
cultural statistics, as if their task could be condensed wholly in the 
delineation of a "physiology" of society. Nor in this regard can we 
forget how the medical applications of statistics were, at the time, 
significant for the methodological evolution of statistics, as in 
Francis Galton's theory of regression and correlation. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We
 must bear in mind that the objective of 19th century national policies 
was to achieve an assimilation, rather than an integration, of 
differences. Their scope was to affirm a culture of homologation in 
which diversity had little value in itself; it mattered only as a 
symptom of a potential "deviance". This is why 19th century statistics 
borrowed languages, methods and spheres of inquiry from medicine. 
Statistics was a social therapy, ready to approach differences as if 
they were potential anomalies to be smoothed over in a homogeneous 
framework. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">However,
 the notion of deviance/variance is to be understood not only in its 
pathological aspect, but in relation to a "normalcy" considered as 
typical and axiomatic. Ignoring the discomfort arising from the heavy 
ideological cloak in which it was wrapped at the time, the notion of 
deviance/variance had structural aspects, connected to the bond between 
statistics and nation. Every national culture in fact tended to beware 
of particularities, which are seen as archaic and potentially divisive, 
factors of resistance to the entropy required by the new society. 
National culture often did so as an anti-discrimination measure. In 
other words, statistics became a tool of nation-building in as much as 
it worked, dynamically and continuously, for the integration of 
subcultures in the crucible of a new group identity, the nation. That 
this has often happened by switching the analytical categories of 
equality with those of uniformity depends on ulterior cultural and 
epistemological reasons, unrelated eo ipso to statistics, which is a 
secondary epiphenomenon of these broader reasons. What does count, 
instead, is that statistics, in its work of institutionalisation of a 
given social structure, has in any case asserted that homogeneity must 
be proven rather than assumed. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Proof
 of this can be grasped reflecting on the truly extraordinary 
concomitance, starting in the 1880s, with which the majority of European
 states began to concentrate part of their statistical functions in the 
labour administrations. In Switzerland, the establishment of the 
Arbeitersekretariat in 1886/87 inaugurated a long series of social 
investigations. In France the same took place with the institution of 
the Office du travail in 1891, which wound up shouldering the majority 
of statistical surveys pertaining to the Ministries of Trade and of 
Agriculture; in 1907 the Office du travail was promoted to the rank of 
ministry, taking with it its statistics division. In 1908 a Commission 
for Labour Statistics was instituted in Berlin with the task of 
supervising the creation of related legislation. In Great Britain the 
Labour Department was created and charged with similar tasks. In the 
Hapsburg monarchy a similar office was created in 1898. In Italy a 
labour office was established in 1902; with its transformation into a 
ministry in 1920 this office co-opted the Office of General Statistics. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 contemporaneous nature of this genesis of a national mechanism to 
register social experience in Europe is quite singular. And it 
underscores the fact that the twin perspectives of representation and 
intervention are hard to separate in relation to the history of 
statistics. The studies conducted on these particular institutions [6, 
8, 11, 25, 27] stressed the cognitive tasks these perspectives 
performed. So intervention and social representation go hand in hand. 
And statistics, during the years of insurgence of the "worker question",
 once again became the tool of nation-building, contributing to give a 
voice and recognition to a new class of citizens. </p><a id="AN9710051198-7"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9710051198-7" title=" 6.

 shows how the relationship between statistics and nation-building has 
taken different paths in different European experiences. An analysis of 
these different paths allows us not only to better comprehend the 
questions connected to the role of statistics, but also to propose for 
the present and the future a number of relevant options and lessons. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We
 noted above that the modem concept of the "nation" revolves around two 
interdependent variables: political subjectivity and cultural identity. 
The same type of oscillation characterises the modem history of 
statistics, which is contained between two poles: administration and 
science. If we take statistics as a tool of nation-building, we can 
ascertain how each of these components has predominated in the building 
of a national identity. Predominant but never exclusive components: 
because of the "institutional" function assigned to it as of the 19th 
century, statistics has become an element in the formation of a state 
rationality [10] and is able to fully justify its own raison d'etre with
 this double status. It cannot opt for one or the other without 
abdicating its own ability to operate. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We
 will attempt to identify concisely, in regard to the most significant 
European experiences, the organisational forms statistics has assumed in
 contributing to performing its tasks in shaping the national framework.
 The pivotal role of statistics in institutions mirrors the significance
 attributed to it in the relationship between the state and civil 
society, the two essential components in the development of the nation. 
The diversity of models also shows how the institutionalisation of 
statistics is capable of revealing some of the idiosyncracies of 
individual national cultures. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Using
 the twin poles of science and administration, we can formulate a sort 
of progressive list according to the influence excerted by each. As a 
role, we classify the organisation of statistics in relation to the 
birth of the different national states in Europe on the basis of the 
choice between either a Ministerial Office, or a Scientific Commission, 
or a mixed model (inclusion of external experts in ministerial bodies). 
It is then clear that science has been able to have a greater impact in 
the public organisation of statistics in the case of the choise of the 
Commission model. Yet history shows that in every case science and 
administration have both been essential to the development of 
statistics. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Let
 us take the case of Great Britain. Despite the establishment of a 
Statistical Office within the Board of Trade (1832) and the institution 
of a General Register Office (1837), private institutions guaranteed the
 relevance of statistics, at least in the beginning. As has been noted 
[7], the studies conducted by the Statistical Societies of London and 
Manchester (both founded in the 1830s) led to the definition of the work
 of statistics as "a movement of institutions on the road to reform, 
from Whig to Liberal in politics". Probably because of the social 
problems arising from the precocious "Industrial Revolution", and 
because of specific British institutional tradition, civil society 
participated to a much greater degree in the process of 
self-representation in Great Britain than in any other European state. 
Members of the statistical societies were not only anti-Ricardian 
economists who were strongly in favour of empirical research but, 
especially in Manchester, certain industrialists who were attempting to 
put a stop to the moral degradation brought about by industrialisation, 
by linking progress in production to social order. On the contrary, it 
was only in 1860 that the Societe de statistique of Paris was founded. 
In the British experience the administration certainly played an 
important part; but its role was stimulated by Parliament through the 
famous investigations (the 19th century "blue books") which helped to 
redefine the national identity on specific questions in a formal process
 closely connected to the issues emerging in civil society. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A
 similar process took place in Germany. On the surface, Germany seemed 
to rely wholly on the public administration to develop its own 
statistics. We need only recall the early foundation of the Statistical 
Office in the Customs Union in 1833; the establishment of the Federal 
Statistical Office in 1872; the monolithic character of its bureaucratic
 organisation founded on three levels: the offices of the federated 
states; the cities, with their autonomous statistical services; and 
private statistics. Nonetheless, it was not only through administration 
that statistics co-operated in forming a national identity. It also 
operated through the influence of an intellectual class. In fact, a 
constant trait of Imperial and Wilhelmine Germany was the bond between 
university teaching and the top levels of bureaucracy. In the case of 
statistics, this bond was even tighter. Despite the purely practical 
foundation of the Amtsstatistik in 1872, German statistics continued to 
have very strong ties, at the personal level and in the circulation of 
ideas, with the "sciences of the state and of the police", from which 
statistics originated in the German world. This is shown by the fact 
that Ernst Engel, the authoritative director of the Prussian Statistical
 Office from 1862 to 1880, was one of the founding members of the Verein
 fur Sozialpolitik, the laboratory of German social sciences, in which 
many other German statistics officials collaborated. It is also 
demonstrated by the official statistics publications, which had great 
success in the periodicals devoted to the analysis of social sciences 
and of the state; and by the statistical offices, especially in Munich 
and Berlin, which also performed intense teaching activity through 
seminars and lectures [4, 23, 24]. It is further reflected in the 
debate, which continued well into the 20th century, on the autonomous or
 auxiliary role of statistics as a science, that is whether this 
discipline played an autonomous or rather only an "instrumental" role, 
but insofar as an "ordering" one, worthy of respect within the social 
sciences, which, between the 19th and 20th centuries, were searching for
 their own charter. The polemics against Queteletisrnus, which in the 
1860s also involved the future director of the Imperial Statistics 
Office, Gustav Rumelin, reminds us of that holistic and historicist 
conception of science that is a characteristic of other spheres of 
German culture [15]. But as regards the status of the discipline of 
statistics it also alludes to a still vital relationship with the 18th 
century tradition of "political sciences", re-experienced in a practical
 and specialist context. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Let
 us conclude by noting that the model of statistical organisation in 
Commissions introduced by Belgium in 1841, and subsequently imitated by 
Spain and the majority of Italian states prior to unification, 
constitutes only one mode of representing the science, making it capable
 of a sort of self-administration. The progressive decline of 
Statistical Commissions in the 19th century in favour of ministerial 
bodies or mixed models might also suggest that their practicality was 
especially tied to two factors: on the one hand, a precise 
epistemological declension of statistics, totally centred around the 
autonomy of the discipline, on the other, the homogeneous values in 
which liberal bourgeois society believed. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">At
 the opposite end of the spectrum are the experiences that relied 
pre-eminently on public administration, as was the case, for example, in
 France, Denmark, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Italy following 
unification. But we must qualify this remark and draw some distinctions.
 Thus, the example of France teaches that statistics, at least at 
certain particularly significant moments, served to legitimise on a 
scientific basis the activities of the administrative structures. If we 
consider the first Office of statistics of the Napoleonic period, we 
recall that its establishment and the surveys it conducted were closely 
tied to the Enlightenment requirement to construct specific knowledge in
 support of the administrative power the Revolution had so radically 
transformed: "La science de l'administration se compose surtout de la 
connaissance des faits", read one of the first bulletins addressed to 
the newly created prefects. The statistics of the time was conceived as a
 tool to guarantee communications between the citizen and the republican
 administration. As late as 1819 Joseph-Marie de Gerando, inaugurating 
the teaching of administrative law in the Sorbonne, still defined 
statistics in this way [26]. And the extreme fragmentation of 
statistical functions within French administrative structures, a 
characteristic eliminated only after the creation of INSEE following 
World War II, was justified by this definition, which marked the 
introduction of statistics into French post-Revolution public 
administration. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">A
 comparison with the Italian situation is very instructive because it 
shows how an identical public organisation of statistics, set in a 
different cultural and political context, led to different results. In 
1861, during the unification process, the Central Statistical Office was
 established within the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry and Trade. 
This placement was directly borrowed from the French model, which in 
1833 had established the general statistical service within the Ministry
 of Trade. In Italy this situation remained substantially unchanged 
until 1882, when the consulting body of the Statistical Office, the 
Giunta di statistica, was transformed into a High Council with an 
integrated representation of public officials and academic scholars. An 
analogous body was established in France in 1898, stimulated by the 
Italian example [17]. Yet Italian statistics suffered enormously from 
this dispersion of statistical functions that seemed quite natural in 
the French ministerial solution. Starting in the 1890s, Italian 
statistics entered a declining phase, quite the opposite of the 
statistical boom in the Third French Republic. The Italian case points 
out how official statistics, even though enjoying administrative 
authority, can be influential and operative only to the extent to which 
it finds allies and legitimisation in society and the political system. 
In the 1890s a very formalistic conception of public administration 
began to spread in Italy and impeded functional administration from 
continuing to play a "constitutional" and truly effective role. In the 
French model, the very fulcrum and bulwark of public administration 
resided in the General Office of Statistics. This disinterest of the 
Italian public administration was demonstrated in those same years by 
interrupting the prefects drawing up the statistics of the province they
 headed, until then a post-Unification tradition [ 12]. </p><a id="AN9710051198-8"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9710051198-8" title=" 7.

 the relationship between statistics and nation-building we treated 
centralised, institutional organisational experiences and federal 
experiences as one. We must recognise that the different institutional 
forms of national organisation have led Statistical Offices to organise 
their relationships with the periphery according to different models. 
From this standpoint the German imperial experience --centred around the
 distinction between central, federal, special or municipal statistics 
-- remains a model, precisely because it impeded an excessive dispersion
 of resources and energy. It would certainly be a mistake to attribute 
this coordination function performed by the imperial office only to the 
federal structure of the state. There are other causes, as we pointed 
out, that made statistics a cornerstone of the material constitution of 
Germany. On the contrary, we can point out the difficulties the Swiss 
Federal Office faced, especially in the years following its 
establishment (1860), in co-ordinating with the individual cantons. But 
the 19th century German statistical organisation obliges us to remember 
that statistics within the nation states has also operated as a vehicle 
for forms of multiple affiliation. In the Kingdom of Italy there was a 
hidden, still unexplored heritage of local statistics drawn up by 
different administrations (municipalities, chambers of commerce, 
provincial administrations, etc.). It would be short-sighted not to 
consider these sources as part of the body of official statistics. Even 
though they were regarded as local by the Central Statistical Offices, 
these local statistics were tools in building a strong territorial 
identity and circulated, above all, in the strategic places and times of
 the great changes taking place. In the same way, the European 
experience of "municipal socialism" made a resumption of statistical 
surveys at the municipal level topical everywhere [30]. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 process of building national identities often coexisted with these 
different forms of political identity, even when they were not expressly
 admitted into the official circuit. Their existence also recalls how, 
in the strongest moments of cultural identity expressed by the 
nation-state, there were spaces for other social affiliations and bonds.
 And these, too, matured and developed using the same statistical tools.
 </p><a id="AN9710051198-9"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9710051198-9" title=" 8. Conclusions  "> 8. Conclusions  </a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">We
 noted that, today, the nation is undergoing a process of profound 
evolution everywhere. This dynamic of change is generally misunderstood 
and often mismanaged. For this reason it may change from a factor of 
civil growth and cultural enrichment into a threat to stability and of 
social conflict. History teaches that statistics can be a potent 
contribution to understanding the processes of change underway. In so 
doing, it can lead the way to positive solutions to national questions, 
removing them from the sphere of irrationality, ideology and passion. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Furthermore,
 the nation is also a point of reference that is becoming less and less 
exclusive. Today it is possible and, in certain respects necessary, to 
have different affiliations, changeable cultural identities and plural 
forms of aggregation. Local communities, national societies, 
professional, religious or ethnic bonds, regional aggregations (such as 
the European Union, NAFTA, Mercosur, etc.), and the international 
community require a commitment and attribute the rights and duties of 
membership to many persons. So there are always more citizens who regard
 themselves as contextual participants in different communities or 
"nations". On this level, as well, statistics plays an essential role in
 identifying and monitoring analogies and differences, convergences and 
divergences. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">Finally,
 the nation today is facing a new context created by globalization, by 
information and telecommunications technologies, and by the spreading of
 values of freedom connected to the pervasiveness of the models of the 
market economy and pluralist democracy. This context leads to a 
loosening of the objective, natural and, we may call them, "imposed" 
bonds and to an enhancement of the subjective and voluntary dimensions 
of nationality, which imply choices, commitment and personal 
responsibility. In short, the nation ceases to be a "given" and becomes 
the object of free cultural choice. A recent example illustrates this 
change clearly. In France there is an age-old debate on the definition 
of nationality which opposes the defenders of the ius sanguinis and the 
defenders of the ius soli. The Commission on Reform of the Nationality 
Code, established in 1987, distanced itself from this classic opposition
 in its conclusions, maintaining that nationality must be the result of a
 choice by the new comer, that this choice must be facilitated as much 
as possible, and that France must carry out a policy to integrate 
immigrants. This is not a new position within French culture. In 1882 
the religious historian Ernest Renan affirmed that the existence of a 
nation "is a daily plebiscite" and the only legitimate guideline to 
define affiliation was "the vote of the nations" [21]. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">"This
 conclusion", noted Touraine, "has a broad scope: against all the 
definitions, whether of the majority or the minorities, based on data of
 a social nature or cultural heredity that shapes individuals, this 
extends the French definition of nationality which becomes the will to 
live together, denying that, to be French, one must cease having other 
bonds" [28, p. 391]. This evolution could fruitfully be reflected upon 
the statistical definitions of migrant worker and national worker. In 
fact, as we know, until now, little progress has been achieved in 
applying international standards to migration statistics, and the 
international comparability of these data is scant, also because of the 
variability, elusiveness and multidimensional nature of the concept of 
nationality. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">The
 history of the relations between statistics and nation-building offers 
rich and well-developed experiences and indications. Different paths 
have been taken and, as we noted, it would be difficult to build 
stylised national models of this relationship without falling into 
abstract generalisations. Still, one fact is certain. Throughout the 
19th century statistics worked on behalf of social cohesion. This is the
 common aspect shared by France and Germany, Great Britain and Italy. 
Within each of these different national experiences, one specific 
component was the guarantor of cohesion - within these experiences that 
we have indicated as necessary for the public relevance of statistics. 
To put it simply, we can affirm that political economy predominated in 
countries in which economic and production changes were more radical, as
 in Great Britain during the Industrial Revolution. Vice versa, public 
administration was the key element in countries in which the nation was 
understood as an artefact of history rather than a natural fact, as in 
France. Finally, science prevailed in contexts in which the scientific 
method was able to stake its claim to an autonomous role in the 
different "constitutional" contexts, affirming itself to be a precise 
political, rather than cultural, choice, as was the case in Germany and 
Belgium. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">There 
are, then, four aspects in the relationship between statistics and 
nation-building which emerge from this historical excursus and which 
qualify the fundamental contribution statistics has made in the past and
 can still make in the future. </p><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">1.
 First and foremost, statistics has contributed to the documentation and
 analysis of economic phenomena, or better of the processes of 
"political economy". Today, globalization, the liberalisation of world 
trade and regional integration, particularly the Economic and Monetary 
Union and the political integration of Europe, are giving statistics new
 tasks. So statistics is becoming a basic tool of aggregation and 
economic development. The experience of the Maastricht convergence 
indicators and of all the statistics required by the EMU in Europe 
offers proof of this. </p><ul><li><span class="medium-normal">2. Second,
 the building or rebuilding of a framework of social cohesion, of the 
sense of affiliation with a community, of shared civic values, of a 
homogeneous, open and integrated cultural identity is a fundamental 
necessity in the face of spreading social exclusion and inequality. This
 is true at the city and regional level, and also at the level of states
 and continents. Statistics must bridge a serious gap in our ability to 
comprehend and measure hardship, the loss of identity, loneliness, 
abandonment and suffering, individually and collectively. </span></li><li><span class="medium-normal">3.
 The third aspect concerns the public administration. Today, more than 
in the past, we require transparency and effectiveness. Statistics plays
 a fundamental role in promoting and supporting institutional reforms in
 answer to the needs of the nation and of nations. Federalism, 
decentralisation, improved co-ordination and strategic planning, 
redefinition of the social security system, information superhighways, 
lifelong education and continuing training, etc. </span></li><li><span class="medium-normal">4.
 The fourth aspect has to do with statistics as a science. As in the 
past, statistics is also called on today to pose national questions on 
the level of scientific reflection, facts, real data and feasible 
solutions. Modem nations have far more need of statistics in the service
 of science and knowledge than they do of flags, anthems, uniforms, 
symbols and demonstrations. A society based on information and knowledge
 makes us dangerously vulnerable to the risk of populism and new forms 
of manipulation, authoritarianism and aggression, which, as experience 
has taught us, can easily degenerate into well-known forms of violence, 
intolerance and oppression. The culture of modem nations is made up of 
scientific method, above all, and history has to be analysed in a 
scientific manner, so that it can orientate the future, and make us 
avoid the errors, and horrors, of the past. </span></li></ul><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">These
 four elements could suffice to identify a common cultural platform for 
the newly emerging "European nation", the building of which represents 
the most ambitious objective of the end of this century and the greatest
 hope for the century to come. Howewer, these elements are certainly 
enough, in our view, to indicate in which directions statistics can 
contribute to the development of nations, to the dialogue among peoples,
 and to social and economic progress. </p><a id="AN9710051198-10"> </a><span class="medium-bold"><h3><a data-auto="ep_link" href="#toc" onclick="FocusElement('toc');" id="hd_toc_AN9710051198-10" title=" References  "> References  </a></h3></span><p class="body-paragraph" data-auto="body_paragraph">[1] Arendt, H.
